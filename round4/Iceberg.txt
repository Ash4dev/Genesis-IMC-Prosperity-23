Polaris' ice chandeliers
steady on the decline;
renewed interest from
unexpected corner?

Polaris' ice chandeliers haven't been
very popular lately, to say the least.
Their value has been steadily falling
for a year straight. Much to the
delight of the large colonies that
have been shorting them. But rumor
has it that there's a renewed interest
emerging from within the Sleddit
community. Could this be the break
Polaris so desperately needs?


IceBuckets' offer to take over
Cones Bros. accepted
Cones Bros. are famous for their
crispy cones, and their huge potential
hasn't gone unnoticed by the bigger

Bros. now states they have accepted

Blizzard 'Benny' hits Snow Cone
County; central heating system
wrecked

Blizzard 'Benny' continues to wreak
havoc across the archipelago. As soon
as it hit land three days ago, it
wrecked the central heating system of
the archipelago, leaving large
populations of penguins in the cold.
And although they generally like cold,
there's a limit to how cold it can get
before they get the shivers. Resilient
as they are, they already found a
solution in the form of fashionable
thermal underwear. And now that
everybody wants a pair or two, supply
chains are struggling to keep up with
the increasing demand.


Demand for Iced Cotton Candy
plummeted after last week's
suspicious yellow stains
The sweetness of Iced Cotton Candy
has gone sour after last week's
"yellow stain incidents". Concerned
penguins sounded the alarm on the
Iced Cotton Candy vendors six days
ago, when some of the treats weren't
as crispy white as they should have
been. The cause is still unsure, but the
verdict of the general population has
been relentless. Since then, the
situation has felt like an unsweetened
deadlock.

CEO of Coat Rack Company Ltd.:
tuxedos should be mandatory for
all penguins visiting cultural
venues;

Karen the Caribou raised some
penguin eyebrows yesterday, when
she stated that all penguins should
wear a tuxedo when they go out to
theaters, restaurants or any other
form of cultural entertainment. "It
would be a great improvement for the
eye," the CEO of Coat Rack Company
Ltd. stated. "And if it gets too hot with
your jacket on, there's always a spot
nearby to hang it."

far-reaching consequences. The new
